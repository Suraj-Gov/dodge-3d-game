# dodge-3d-game
 
Dodge The Blocks, aka dodge-3d-game is a fast paced, endless runner. The player controls a red block, which can majorly move in a single axis, and can jump to a certain height. The main goal is to avoid hitting the blocks. The player lose their size and mass by 8% when they jump. The player can pickup power ups to either increase their size or to become invincible for a short time. The obstacles are spawned in a randomized order. Highscores are recorded. 

Added the ability to alter movement sensitivity and block spawn intervals.
